"""Snapshot → PpakSpec synthesizer.

Turns a list of :class:`Snapshot` (from the resolver) into a :class:`PpakSpec`
ready for Track A's ``build_ppak()`` byte builder.

Algorithm:
- For every (group, pad, bars) tuple appearing in any snapshot, emit ONE
  :class:`Pattern` containing a single trigger event at position 0 over the
  whole pattern length. Patterns are deduped across snapshots.
- For every (group, pad) used, emit ONE :class:`PadSpec` carrying the sample
  slot from ``manifest.session_tracks``.
- For every snapshot, emit ONE :class:`SceneSpec` mapping each group to the
  pattern index it triggers (or 0 if silent).

See ``specs/ep133-arrangement-song-export.md`` §"Snapshot resolution algorithm"
+ §"Component contracts".
