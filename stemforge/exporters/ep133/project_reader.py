"""
Read EP-133 project files as raw binary over SysEx.

Discovered 2026-04-24. Project files are TAR archives living at fileId
``3000 + (project_num - 1) * 1000`` (so project 1 = 3000, project 7 = 9000).
They contain pad records for all 4 groups × 12 pads, plus patterns/scenes.

Read flow (device in read-file mode):

    1. FILE_INIT with flags=0 (read)
    2. 03 00 <project_fid:u16 BE> <u32 offset=0>
    3. loop: 03 01 <page:u16 BE>
       until a response comes back shorter than the usual 327 raw bytes,
       which signals EOF.

Each page response has a 3-byte header ``00 00 NN`` where NN is the page
number. The remainder is content. Concatenating the content portion of
every page yields the full TAR.

Notes:

- ``03 00`` only accepts a zero offset — the device returns
  "offset not supported for raw" for non-zero offsets, so pagination is
  strictly sequential from page 0.
- Do NOT call ``03 00`` on arbitrary fileIds that aren't known-readable
  files (samples or projects). Speculative opens can wedge the device
  into an error state requiring a power cycle. See memory
  ``feedback_ep133_probing_safety`` for details.
